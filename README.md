# randomly little scripts i wrote

## sort_favs.py

Python script to alphabetically sort the favourites file for ITG/Simply Love.

The script also looks out for parentheses and brackets in the front of folder names, because people tend to put those there for some reason.

Put this file into your profile's folder (the same one containing `favorites.txt`) and run it. It will back up the original file in case something goes horribly wrong.
